# AI-Based Seasonal Crop Advisor üå±

AI-Based Seasonal Crop Advisor is a web-based tool designed to provide intelligent crop recommendations to farmers and gardening enthusiasts. By inputting environmental factors like location, season, soil type, and rainfall, users can receive tailored advice on the best crops to plant for a successful harvest.

## üöÄ Features

* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple form to input environmental data.
* **Dynamic Recommendations:** Fetches and displays crop suggestions based on user input.
* **API-Driven:** Designed to connect to a custom-trained machine learning model for intelligent, data-driven advice.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for great performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure and content of the web application.
* **CSS:** For styling the user interface.
* **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions, form submission, and API communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You just need a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

### Deployment
    ```sh
    https://seasonal-crop-advisor.vercel.app
    ```
### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/itshell4/sprout-smart-advisor.git](https://github.com/itshell4/sprout-smart-advisor.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd sprout-smart-advisor
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file in your file explorer.

## üîå API Integration

This application is designed to fetch recommendations from your custom-trained model via an API. To connect your model, you need to update the JavaScript file.

1.  Open the `script.js` file.
2.  Find the following line of code (around line 28):
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('YOUR_MODEL_API_ENDPOINT_HERE', {
    ```
3.  Replace `'YOUR_MODEL_API_ENDPOINT_HERE'` with the actual URL of your deployed model's API endpoint.
4.  If your API requires an authentication key, you can add it to the `headers` object.

## üìà Future Improvements

* **Geolocation API:** Automatically detect the user's location to pre-fill the form.
* **Detailed Care Instructions:** Provide more in-depth advice, including watering schedules, fertilizer recommendations, and pest control tips.
* **Visual Data:** Include images of the recommended crops.
* **User Accounts:** Allow users to save their location and track their planting history.
